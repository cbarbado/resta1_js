Resta 1 - Javascript (Peg Solitaire)

This is my first Javascript code, so I know there is a lot of opportunities to improve it. Even so, it decided to keep it as is, to serve as a baseline.

It's purpose is to develop a Peg Solitaire game in a Canvas.

Peg Solitaire was the first game I wrote in early 1980's, when I was a kid. It was originally written in BASIC, on a TRS-80 Color 8 bits home computer.
Since then I often write it again using different technologies/languages.

Thanks for viewing this!
